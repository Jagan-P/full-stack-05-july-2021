CSS:

1. Inline styles - Add the styles in DOM element (<div>, <p>) using style (for eg: <div style="color: red"></div>)
2. Page level styles - Styles are defined in the <head> section of the document (using css selectors tag, id, class)
3. External CSS - Styles are declared outside the document and included in the document using href (using css selectors)


CSS selectors:
1. Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
2. Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
3. Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
4. Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
5. Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

Events can be of two categories,
1. Browser events - Where user doesn't play any role (Eg: onload)
2. User events - User performs this event (Eg: scroll, click)


Most of the times you don't have direct access to html, because it comes from plugins.
So attaching events is achieveable only through event delegation.

tr
    - td (click)
    - td

td, td
index%2 - true, false
sameNode - true, false
you saw output

    - td
    - td (click)

td, td
index%2 - true, false
sameNode - false, true
you don't see output
